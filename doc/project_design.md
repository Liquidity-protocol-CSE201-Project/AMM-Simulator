## Functionalities

   We are building a market simulator to test different already existing liquidity protocols and eventually come up with our own automated market making algorithm and implement it.
   The market simulator will have functionalities such as: exchanging different crypto currencies, providing liquidity, remove liquidity
   The different protocols are: constant product, constant sum, balancer etc.
   Arbitrage traders will be implemented as market participants as well.
   The different simulations, pros and cons of different protocols will be displayed in QT.

## Deadlines and deliverables
  
  Week 1: 
  - Have multiple chosen research papers on incentive mechanism of such a market and understand precisely different protocols
  - Implement a very basic version of the market simulator (be able to swap coins)
  - Implement the most basic liquidity protcols: constant product, constant sum, balancer

    Try to plan different stages for your project and have intermediate results you can show for each stage. This exercise will help you focusing your efforts and minimize the risks of failure.

## Software Architecture

    - How are you sub-dividing your project?Which modules are you implementing?

    - What is the interface of each module?
      You can define the interface with the public section of your class headers (note that not all classes need to be "exposed" from one module to the others).

    - What external dependencies do you have? Why?
